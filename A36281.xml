         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THAT there is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme inviſible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creator and Governour of the World, is a grand Truth to which we yield our common aſſent from the evidence of natural reaſon, as well as the revelation of holy Scripture. None but a fool will call it into queſtion in his thoughts; and he muſt be an impudent profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wretch that dares deny it with <note place="margin">Pſal. 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now when we ſay there is a God, we do with the ſame breath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he is to be honour'd and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd by us; for the very notion of a Deity doth imply an undeniable title to our greateſt ſervice. His nature is tranſcendently excellent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:56907:3"/> and therefore the higheſt acts of veneration are due to him; this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of divine Worſhip is urg'd by the Pſalmiſt; who thus beſpeaking the Angels (as the Text is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Worſhip him all ye Gods,</hi> ſubjoyns immediately after, <hi>For thou Lord art high above all the earth, thou art exalted far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Gods, Pſal. 79. 7.</hi> And <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> the ſame is aſſign'd by a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in Gentile Theology, <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may juſtly challenge the worſhip of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ſuperlative Excellence, Bleſſedneſs, Eternity; for whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excells hath on that account a veneration due to it.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Moreover as God is founder of the World, and more eſpecially as Author of our own being, he doth juſtly challenge our humbleſt adoration, this is likewiſe given in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>So intimate is Religion to the Soul of Man, that ſome of the Learned have thought it to be of his very Eſſence, and that 'tis the primary difference (rather than reaſon) by which we are diſtinguiſh'd from Brutes; for there ſeem to be ſome imperfect diſcoveries of reaſon in the actings of other living Creatures; inſomuch as that ſeveral Philoſophers, both Antient and Modern, have not doubted to affirm, that they are in a lower degree truly rational.

            </p>
            <p>It might in reaſon indeed be thought unneceſſary, that Perſons bred up in the Church of Chriſt, eſpecially in ſuch a part of it as ours, where the Bible is vulgarly known, and practical Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo clearly taught; ſhould be call'd upon to pay their tribute of ſervice to the Almighty. But however we may
<pb facs="tcp:56907:6"/> unhappily obſerve, how innate depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and the immorality of mens lives do alienate them from God and his Worſhip, there are too many every where who live by Senſe more than by Faith or Reaſon. And becauſe God is not preſent to their outward ſight, as were the Idols of the Heathen, he is alſo abſent from their thoughts: and they are not apprehenſive 'tis of any great concern to them that they attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in the Duties of his Service.</p>
            <p>But the more eaſie and common impiety in this kind is the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of thoſe Devotions which ſhould be in private Families, and in the retirements of particular perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. For ſecuring the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God the National Government hath been very Zealous, there being penal Laws for bringing men to it; and they find themſelves oblig'd to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Ordinances of our Religion, not only by the fear of God, but alſo by that of the Magiſtrate, who beareth not the ſword in vain. And for the ſolemn ſervice of God in Parochial Aſſemblies 'tis abundantly provided in our Liturgy: wherein are pious forms
<pb facs="tcp:56907:6"/> for all publick occaſions, compos'd at firſt by the renown'd Reformers of this Church and Kingdom, <hi>Men who hazarded their lives</hi> (and ſome of them loſt them too) <hi>for the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and in defence of his Truth and Goſpel. To theſe great Worthies, the Souls of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are more endebted under God than words can expreſs: and their Memories as well as their Reformation ſhould be for ever precious to us.</p>
            <p>But though the publick exerciſe of Religion be ſo well cared for, yet there are not the like furtherances of private Devotion; by the commands of God indeed, and by all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Divine Worſhip, Domeſtick Piety is no leſs requir'd than that of the Temple. But yet it is not inforc'd by any humane Laws; nor hath the Church thought fit to recommend any Forms of Devotion either for Cloſet or Family; that the Prayers in our Liturgy are not preſcribed with reſpect to private Houſes, ſo as to be obliging there, is declar'd by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve of other Forms to be us'd
<pb facs="tcp:56907:7"/> in Families, but alſo that it may be in Viſitation of the ſick, though there be an Office in the book of Common Prayer for that occaſion. And it hath been thought by ſome, having as high an eſteem for the Liturgy as others, that conſidering the general temper of men, it would much abate their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the publick ſervice, and make them more ſlack; and regardleſs in their attendance at the Church, if the Devotions there were no other than what they have every day in their own Houſes. But whether ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> no doubt, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> which injoyn religious Duties, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Sanction of Penalties annex'd to them, do only reſpect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places of Worſhip. So that elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where men are left to the alone obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And 'tis the leſs to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that this ſo conſiderable a part of Chriſtian Piety is no more practic'd. The neglects of holy Duties in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies may be too well known: and thoſe others more private may be alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd without any breach of charity.</p>
            <p>But 'tis much to be lamented that
<pb facs="tcp:56907:7"/> any inſtructed in the Diſcipline of the Goſpel ſhould think it enough to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the glorious God their Creator one day in the Week, and content themſelves with ſo much only of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as the Laws of their Country do force from them.</p>
            <p>Now if we enquire how this may come to paſs; beſide the ſinful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of men and their averſation thereupon from the exerciſes of Piety; it may be thought generally to proceed either from this, that they do not ſufficiently know, or at leaſt are ſo ſtupid as not to conſider their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in Conſcience to the Duties they thus omit, and how much their own intereſt is concern'd in the due performance of them: or elſe in ſome it may doubtleſs be from a want of aſſiſtance to their Devotion, while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of ſuitable compos'd Prayers in which they ſhould addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God.</p>
            <p>Both which probable cauſes of ſo great irreligion the Author was willing to remove. The former of them by his following Perſwaſives: and the atter by ſome compoſures for Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
<pb facs="tcp:56907:8"/> Devotion thereunto ſubjoin'd. In the <hi>Perſwaſives</hi> he hath not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken any exact diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devotion as to the nature of it, it's ſeveral parts and the manner of due performance; much leſs to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Reader with an elaborate flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of words; but his deſign is only to inforce the Practiſe of this great Duty by a Summary of Arguments which ſeem'd moſt material: and to do it with ſuch plaineſs, as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more apt to convince and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thoſe of meaneſt capacity.</p>
            <p>And the Prayers here offer'd by him to the uſe of well diſpos'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are but a few; being only for ordinary occaſions, excepting thoſe in caſe of Sickneſs. In all of them he he hath choſen ſtill to take in what he thought pertinent and neceſſary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than boaſt his own invention in an affected variety.</p>
            <p>Hoping his good intention herein will attone for any leſſer failings that may occur to the Critical, he doth ſend them abroad with this one ſhort Prayer more; <hi>that by the Divine bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they may prove really uſeful to
<pb facs="tcp:56907:8"/> the furtherance and help of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Devotion, and for promoting the ſervice and honour of the Great God, of whom and to whom are all things.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>PRayer</hi> is a Duty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip, wherein we own God for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being and Lord of the World, and yield him Honour and Adoration as ſuch; wherein we acknowledge our dependance on him, we ſubmit our ſelves to him, imploring his gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the communications of his goodneſs. This doth belong to Natural Religion, being taught us by our inbred Reaſon; and is a neceſſary conſequent from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a God. Whence the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it hath been univerſal, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56907:11"/> the moſt degenerate of Mankind have us'd to invoke ſome Deity or other. We read <hi>how the Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi> did call upon him from <hi>morning to evening</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 29.</note>; and the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Tempeſt <hi>cried every one unto his God</hi>

                  <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. 5.</note>. We may alſo obſerve from our Saviour, that the Heathen had their Prayers, in which they uſed <hi>vain Repetitions, and did think to be heard for their much ſpeaking</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 7.</note>. It doth appear from their own Writers, how zealous they were in their Idolatrous Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that they had every where their Temples, Prieſts, and ſtated times of Worſhip: And 'twas a received cuſtom among them in every buſineſs of moment they were to undertake, <hi>Initium à precationibus capere</hi>

               </note>, <hi>to begin with Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Church of God Prayer hath been always eſteem'd the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of Religion. We read in the Old Teſtament, how it was in conſtant uſe with thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd the true God. In his Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were offer'd up daily Sacrifices <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 38, 39.</note>, which were ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56907:11"/> with Prayer <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 50. 15, 16, 20, 21.</note>, by which they were recommended to the Divine Acceptance, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip render'd compleat. And they had there a Liturgick Service, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Prayers and Praiſes. Of ſuch the devout Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> are made up; and 'tis with reaſon believ'd, that ſome of theſe were a conſiderable part of that Service; which is probable from the Titles of them, as of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. and 92. and thoſe others which are inſcribed <hi>to the Praecentor</hi> or <hi>Chief Muſician.</hi> It is mention'd when one Pſalm of this ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by him for public uſe <note n="g" place="margin">1 <hi>Chror.</hi> 16. 7.</note>; and we read, that in the time of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> the Prieſts and Levites did <hi>praiſe the Lord in the words of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 30.</note>. Beſide the more ſolemn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Temple, the Jews did likewiſe every day celebrate their Devotions in the Synagogues, which were throughout the Country. And for daily uſe, they were furniſh'd with certain ſet Prayers, eighteen in number, compendiouſly made, that they might be the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56907:12"/> remember'd <note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>D. Lightf. Hor. Heb. in Mat. cap.</hi> 6.</note>. And 'tis affirm'd by <hi>Grotius, Lightfoot,</hi> and other Learned Men, that the Petitions of the Lord's Prayer are for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ſame with theſe of the Jews, and abſtracted from them. So careful were their Rabbi's or Doctors to promote Devotion in their Scholars, that beſide the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prayers, they were wont to recommend to them ſome others of their own compoſing <hi rend="sup">i</hi>. And thus did <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, of whom we find in the Goſpel, that he taught his Diſciples to pray <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1.</note>.</p>
            <p>The uſual times of Prayer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by the Jews, were no leſs than three every day, the third, the ſixth, and the ninth hour. And it hath been a Tradition among them, that <hi>the third was inſtituted by</hi> Abraham, <hi>the ſixth by</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the ninth by</hi> Jacob <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Druſ. in cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Act. Apoſt.</hi>
               </note>. To theſe hours we muſt refer the Devotions of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> when we read, they were performed by them <hi>three times a day</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10.</note>. It was from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Prayer, eſpecially that their Phylacteries were ſo much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56907:12"/> by them, and therefore named <hi>Tephillim</hi> or <hi>Precatoria,</hi> being ſcrolls of Parchment (whereon were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſome parts of the Pentateuch) faſten'd on their foreheads and the wriſts of their hands; and by theſe they intended to be put in mind of their duty to God: Alſo by having them on at the time of praying, they thought they did ſerve him in a manner the more holy and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. From their high opinion of Prayer and its great importance, proceeded that proverbial ſaying among them, <hi>Sine ſtationibus non ſubſiſtere Mundus; without ſtanding Prayers the World would not ſtand:</hi> For by <hi>Statio,</hi> or rather the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word anſwering to it, they uſed to fignifie Prayer, it being one of the ſeven names by which they call it, from the poſture in which it was by them performed; for the Jews (unleſs at the times of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or extraordinary humiliation) did commonly pray ſtanding, as ſeveral places of Scripture do plainly ſhew <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11.</note>, and therefore that Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 22. which by us
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56907:13"/> like as in other verſions, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, <hi>Abraham ſtood before the Lord,</hi> is in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe <hi>Abraham prayed before the Lord;</hi> and from the Jews the ſame might deſcend to the Chriſtians: For that they did anciently pray ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, doth appear out of <hi>Juſtine Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and others. The former-nam'd relating the manner of their pious Exerciſe on the Lord's day, ſaith, <hi>After theſe things we ſtand up all together, and pour out our Prayers:</hi> And in the latter it is, <hi>Quando ſtamus ad ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, &amp;c. When we ſtand at Prayer, moſt dear Brethren, we ought to be watchful, and to attend our Prayers with our whole heart</hi>

               </note>. Though it muſt be ſaid, there is this other account too, why Chriſtians uſed that poſture, namely, that they intended it as ſymbolical of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Reſurrection; and a viſible token of their ſtedſtaſt belief of it; which they knew to be the ſupporting Article of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56907:13"/> and that it was ſo, may be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the ſpecial times in which this Ceremony was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which were every Lord's day, being the day of the week on which Chriſt roſe from the Dead; and from <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the ſolemn Feſtival of the Reſurrection, on every day 'till <hi>Whitſontide</hi>

That ſtanding at Prayer ſhould be generally obſerved at the times now mention'd, the Fathers of the great <hi>Nicene</hi> Council thought fit to enjoyn in their <hi>20th</hi> Canon.</p>
            <p>This minds us to add farther, how the Duty we are upon hath been more eminently exemplified ſince the times of the Goſpel, in the practice of Chriſt himſelf, of his Apoſtles, and of thoſe who profeſs'd the Religion by them taught in the firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. That our Saviour pray'd often, and ſometimes very long, we are inform'd by the Evangeliſts.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56907:14"/> and St. <hi>John</hi> hath tranſmitted to us one compleat Prayer of his which he uſed together with his Diſciples a little before he was betray'd <note n="r" place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 17.</note>. Of the Apoſtles we read, that being met ſoon after their Lord's aſcenſion, <hi>they all continued with one accord in Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Act. 1. 14. Likewiſe when they were to fill up their number, by chuſing one into the room of <hi>Judas</hi>

            <p>The Chriſtians living in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times of Heathen Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were not aſham'd nor afraid to worſhip their God and Saviour, when it was moſt deſpis'd and frown'd upon by the then ruling Powers; and they had Zeal enough to keep up their Religious Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, though they did thereby run
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56907:14"/> the greateſt hazard of their Eſtates, Liberty, and Life it ſelf. <hi>They came together to one place to pray, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one common Prayer, and with one mind</hi>

There is no doubt but the Apoſtles did herein comply with the cuſtom of the Jews, (as they did in other caſes to avoid offence, and the better to gain them over to the Faith) and from their example it got the rather into the practice of other Chriſtians, though without any real obligation on the Conſcience; for no hour of the day is in it ſelf more acceptable to God than another, nor is any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd in the Apoſtolical Writings, but 'tis commanded indifferently that we pray at all times <note n="e" place="margin">

            <p>But however, the devout pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ancient Chriſtians, as before mention'd, ſhould teach us to be aſſiduous and frequent in this holy Exerciſe. And though we cannot charge the Conſcience with a religious regard to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hours, becauſe God himſelf hath not done it; yet from the reaſons of the Duty it ſelf, and from the Scripture Precepts that enjoyn its frequency, we muſt in the general declare it a ſinful omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in any Chriſtian, if he do not ordinarily twice every day at leaſt worſhip God in Prayer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide other times of doing the ſame when uſual opportunities, or any ſpecial occaſion ſhall call him to it.</p>

               </note>. Likewiſe the burning of Incenſe on the golden Altar was order'd to be at the ſame times <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 7, 8.</note>. And ſurely theſe are alſo the fitteſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Spiritual Oblations of our Chriſtian Worſhip. For ſince our whole time is made up of night and day, it ſeems very meet and expedient whether we reſpect God or our ſelves, that at the beginning and end of theſe we ſhould preſent our Religious Service and Prayers to him, in whom we ſtill live and move, and have our being.</p>
            <p>The morning is a fit time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to worſhip and praiſe God, by whom we have been preſerv'd and refreſhed the night foregoing; as alſo for deſiring the guidance and protection of his Grace and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and his Bleſſings both on our ſelves and our undertakings the day following. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth exhort Chriſtians to pray in the morning, that the reſurrection of Chriſt, which was at that time, may be then celebrated by them <note n="l" place="margin">Cypr. de erat.

            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56907:17"/>
            <p>The evening is a time no leſs convenient, wherein to return our Adoration and Thankſgiving for the mercies of the day paſt, to humble our ſelves for the Sins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in committed; as likewiſe wherein to beg a comfortable ſleep and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from all the perils of darkneſs in the night enſuing. And the ſame holy Martyr doth recommend eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Prayer, that ſo the Sun and Light of this World being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from us, we may then deſire the Spiritual Light, and the coming of Chriſt, whom he calls <hi>the true Sun</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Ibid.</note>.</p>
            <p>We may alſo add, that at theſe periods of our time we are moſt at liberty from worldly buſineſs, and therefore the better diſpos'd for Religious Duty: For in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we are not as yet engag'd in the employments of the day, and when even is come, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly over and laid aſide. So that our Devotion as thus timed, is like to be performed in a manner more pleaſing to God, and without hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to us in reſpect of ordinary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56907:18"/> affairs. And that we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to the daily practice of this ſo great and neceſſary Duty, we now proceed to alledge ſome Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which if duly conſidered will not fail of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We are oblig'd to it by God's command, who hath always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that men ſhould in this way of humble addreſs honour him and ſeek his goodneſs. It was impos'd on the Jews, when they were bid <hi>To worſhip the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 10.</note>, and <hi>to ſerve him</hi>

                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. 10. 20.</note>; and that Prayer was hereby enjoyn'd, we have the authority of a great Jewiſh Doctor. <hi>It is an affirmative Precept</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des) that men pray to God every day, for it is ſaid, Ye ſhall ſerve the Lord your God</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>Apud Lud. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. in c.</hi> 3. <hi>Act. Apoſt.</hi>
               </note>. Likewiſe God calls for the ſame from all people; <hi>Look unto me and be ye ſaved, all ye ends of the earth.</hi> Iſa. 45. 22. And the puniſhment of their neglect herein is expreſſed by <hi>Jeremiah; Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not upon thy name.</hi> Jer. 10. 25.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56907:18"/> But in the Goſpel Prayer is more often and earneſtly commanded. Our Saviour enjoyn'd his Diſciples to <hi>watch and pray</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 33.</note>, to <hi>watch and pray always</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36.</note>. He teacheth them, <hi>that men ought always to pray, and not to faint</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1.</note>. And for our direction and aſſiſtance in it, he hath pleas'd to preſcribe us a form compos'd by himſelf. In the Apoſtolical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings the ſame duty is very much urg'd. We are exhorted to betake our ſelves to God in Prayer on all occaſions. <hi>In every thing by prayer and ſupplication let your Requeſts bee made known unto God.</hi> Phil. 4. 6. To call upon him in every place wherever we happen to be. <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. To be conſtant and unwearied in the ſame, for we muſt <hi>continue in Prayer</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2.</note>, and <hi>pray without ceaſing</hi>

                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18.</note>.</p>
            <p>Now Almighty God having thus clearly and ſo often declared his Royal will and command, there is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56907:19"/> no room for debate, whether we are to conform to it or no? His juſt authority over us is ſo great, that we cannot but own our ſelves oblig'd to obey in caſes moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and troubleſom. And how then can we be excus'd, ſhould we refuſe to do it where the duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd is both eaſie in it ſelf, and alſo that on which our own intereſt doth very much depend? For</p>
            <p n="2">II. 'Tis no ſmall enforcement of this Divine Command, that Prayer is alſo declared in Scripture as a condition on our part, by which we become capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thoſe good things whereof we ſtand in need. Though God be infinitely good in himſelf, and delights in being ſo to others; yet we cannot think he will force his Bleſſings on ſuch as care not to beg them at his hands: No, we often read it is quite otherwiſe; for when God giveth good things, 'tis to them <hi>that ask him</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 11.</note>. To ſuch only our Saviour hath given aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they <hi>ſhall receive</hi>

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 10. <hi>John</hi> 16. 24.</note>. And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56907:19"/> he himſelf would not engage to effect any kindneſs for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by his own interceſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they ſhould alſo petition for it. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ſhall ask any thing in my name, I will do it</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 14. 14.</note>. When God is ſaid to be nigh unto his people, 'tis but <hi>In all things that they call upon him for</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7.</note>; and if they <hi>ſeek</hi> him, then he will be found <note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2.</note>. Nor ſhall they find him neither, unleſs they ſeek him <hi>with all their heart</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 13.</note>. If he promiſe to deliver in the time of trouble, he requires to be firſt <hi>call'd upon</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15.</note>. If he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Righteous, 'tis after they <hi>cry</hi> unto him <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 17.</note>. That God doth ſuſpend his giving forth his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to men, on their Prayers for them, is clearly expreſs'd in that of St. <hi>James,</hi> where he aſſigns their not praying for a cauſe or reaſon of their not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; <hi>Ye have not, becauſe ye ask not</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 2.</note>. And this holy Duty is ſo indiſpenſable in order to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the favours of Heaven, that though God paſs his word, and make an expreſs promiſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56907:20"/> any particular Mercies, yet there is no actual performance until he be ſought unto for the ſame. Of this we find an inſtance in the Prophet, by whom God had in abſolute terms declared of many and good things he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do for his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had confirm'd their belief thereof with this, <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, I will do it.</hi> However after all it is ſubjoyn'd, <hi>I will yet for this be enquir'd of by the houſe of Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 37.</note>. So that plainly Prayer is ſtill one condition on which the promiſes of God are made, and his beneficence to be expected by us. If we fail in it, there is little reaſon to hope he will beſtow his benefits, or ſend us any relief in our time of need.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The duty doth appear highly reaſonable and expedient from the conſideration of God, who is the object of our Prayer; as that he is infinitely perfect and glorious, the Creator of us and the whole World, and Governour
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56907:20"/> of all things both in Heaven and Earth, our great Law-giver and moſt juſt Judge, who will reward or puniſh according to our actions: That he can ſave or deſtroy us, make us miſerable or happy <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 12.</note>: That he is the Author of all good, and having all things at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, can do for us whatever we can need or deſire. I ſay, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Almighty in all theſe ſeveral reſpects, we cannot but be ſatisfied, that he is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd and worſhip'd by us, and doth highly deſerve our ſervice and adoration: That we are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd to humble our ſelves at his Footſtool, imploring his mercy, to ſubmit our perſons to him, and placing our whole truſt in his power and goodneſs, to beg at his hands a ſupply of all our wants.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. This holy performance will be thought very congruous and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary on a due conſideration of our ſelves, for we are Beings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely dependent on God, we have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56907:21"/> been created by him, and 'tis by his power and providence that we daily ſubſiſt. Whatever good things we enjoy, whatever do adminiſter to our life, either as to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities or conveniencies thereof, they are all his Creatures, and by him provided for our uſe and benefit. We are weak and frail, expoſed to dangers of all kinds in every place, and every hour of our life; nor have we foreſight or power enough of our own to ſecure our ſelves. Moreover we are guilty Sinners before God, and ſo have forfeited his kindneſs, and made our ſelves obnoxious to his wrath and ſeverity. There are in us corrupt inclinations to ſin. We are ſtill encompaſſed with Temptations, and the Devil is our malicious and ſubtile Adverſary. So that if left to our ſelves, we cannot hope to be holy in this life, nor happy in the next. Now when we thus reflect, 'tis eaſie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how much we are oblig'd to honour and worſhip the Divine Majeſty, and to render to him
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56907:21"/> our daily thanks and praiſe for all that we are or have; how much it doth behove us to deſire his conſtant care and protection, recommending our ſelves to his watchful Providence. We may quickly apprehend of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it is, that with humiliation and hearty repentance we beg the pardon of our ſins, leſt we fall under condemnation and eternal puniſhment; and that we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly crave the aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, whereby we may be able to overcome ſin, and all ſpiritual enemies, and may be <hi>kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. There is in Prayer it ſelf enough to make it deſirable and much valued by us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is highly honourable; for what greater honour then to be taken into an immediate attendance about the Almighty, and to have converſe with the ſupream Monarch of the world, the great <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords?</hi> in reſpect of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56907:22"/> whom the Potentates on Earth, are of an account infinitely mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the vileſt Begger, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to them. And what an high priviledge is it that poor mortals made up of Clay, can be admitted to the Throne of this Glorious Majeſty, there to preſent their Petitions, and to have his ear on all occaſions? Holy <hi>David</hi> was ſo apprehenſive what an advancement it was to wait on God in his Worſhip, that though he were a King, he eſteemed the meaneſt Office in the Temple well worth his ambition, and would be content to be <hi>a Door keeper in Gods houſe</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 10.</note>, rather then live in a ſtate of diſtance and alienation from him. The famous <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> firſt Chriſtian Emperour, thought it much for his honour to be openly repreſented as in the poſture of one at Prayer. And therefore gave order that his own Effigies in the the Impreſſes of the publick Coyn ſhould be ſo faſhion'd. As it was alſo over the Gates of his Palace in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Euſeb. Vit. Conſt. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note>. Certainly whoſoever
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56907:22"/> hath underſtanding enough to know God and himſelf, and to compare the one with the other, will ſee abundant reaſon for ſaying as the pious Father, <hi>that he cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and wonder at the great love of God towards man, for vouchſafing him ſo high an Honour as familiarly to ſpeak unto himſelf by Prayers</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Chryſ. de Orand. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um lib.</hi> 1.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a duty ſo material and comprehenſive, that it doth in a manner take in the Whole of our Religion; our piety to God is largely contain'd in it, ſince by Prayer we acknowledge and honour him as our Creator and Lord, offering up our Souls and Bodies to his ſervice. We profeſs our ſubjection, and rely upon him for all the good we deſire. We do hereby give particular honour to his Divine Attributes, to his Omni-preſence, and infinite Knowledge, in that we ſuppoſe him near at hand, to take notice and hear our Petitions, whereſoever we are: to his Holineſs and Juſtice, by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting our ſins, and deprecating his deſerved puniſhments. To his Mercy and Goodneſs, while we beg
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56907:23"/> forgiveneſs, and all the Bleſſings we ſtand in need of. To his Power and Soveraignty, in that we think him able to do for us in all the things we requeſt of him, and do commit our ſelves to his Care and Providence. We aſcribe to him the Glory of all the great and good things he hath done for us and all Mankind, by our praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Likewiſe we do herein perform our duty with reſpect to Chriſt as our bleſſed Redeemer, in that renouncing all our own Righteouſneſs, we plead his alone merits for our pardon and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and preſent all our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his name, and through his interceſſion.</p>
            <p>There is moreover in Prayer, an happy concurrence of our Chriſtian Graces, and a fruitful exerciſe of them. Of Faith, <hi>for whoſoever cometh unto God, believeth that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</note>. He is perſwaded of his power and readineſs to help, and doth confide in the truth of his word and promiſes. Of Repentance, in our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56907:23"/> humble confeſſion of ſin, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd ſorrow for what we have done amiſs, and our petition for Grace to amend our lives. Of Hope, for tis by it we are encourag'd to pray, and have a comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of receiving the good things we pray for, and our charity ſhews it ſelf while we pray for others as well as our ſelves: and do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to forgive men their treſpaſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, as we deſire God to forgive ours; And it belongs to our holy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that we implore the divine aſſiſtance and Gods holy Spirit for enabling us tomortify ſin, and to lead a ſober, righteous, and Godly life.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the ſubſtance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is thus compriz'd in Prayer, hence it is ſometimes us'd to ſignify a mans duty to God in general, as when it is ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever calleth upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 32. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13.</note>, and in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> account to be they, who <hi>call upon the name of Chriſt,</hi> and to be Chriſtians, are one and the ſame <note n="o" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2.</note>. There being ſo much of piety and holineſs in this one duty, therefore 'tis that God is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56907:24"/> ſo pleas'd with it, <hi>for the Prayer of the righteous is his delight</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8.</note>.

Now if the Prince be thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to uſe his power for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God and Religion, how can we judge otherwiſe of leſſer Governours? and how ſhall it be thought that Maſters of Families have any true Principles towards God, or any regard to his honour while they take no care to have his worſhip perform'd within their private juriſdiction? <hi>If I be a Father (ſaith God) where is my honour?

It cannot be thought that men believe they have a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven while they care not to give evidence of their dutiful obſervance and veneration of him, and are not at all concern'd that reverential regard be paid him by others: nor can we ſuppoſe they really own any ſevere Maſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, while they are not afraid to neglect his ſervice and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of his honour, which is the work he hath impos'd on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56907:41"/> them, and that for which they were ſent into the World. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore domeſtick Governours, as they would be thought to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding enough to know whence they are, and for what they were made; as they would avoid the moſt diſgraceful and odious cenſure of being reckoned atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, are highly concern'd both for atteſting the reality of their Faith and Religion, and for anſwering the great deſign of their being, to employ the authority they have in their own houſes for Gods glory, in ordering the duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be there piouſly obſerv'd by all belonging to them.</p>

            <p>But the Scripture is very ſevere in the Commination of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evils, againſt the contemners of God and Religion; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. from the 15 <hi>Verſe</hi> to the end of that Chapter; they are there threatned with Curſes, in their

And by the Prophet it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd againſt them who neglect their religious addreſſes to God, that they ſhall be unfortunate; <hi>For the Paſtors are become bruitiſh, they have not ſought the Lord, therefore they ſhall not proſper, and all their flocks ſhall be ſcattered,</hi> Jer. 10. 21.

            <p>Though ſome deſpiſers of God and his worſhip may perhaps get themſelves riches, yet either they ſhall not abide, but be as mony put into a bag with holes, as 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in <hi>Haggai</hi>

Wherefore if Maſters of Families would conſult their own Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as to the things of this Life, if they would be happy in what they have and ſucceſsful in what they undertake, they muſt needs account it expedient and of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to them, that God be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſerv'd in their Families, and his favour implor'd, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Prayers.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. 'Tis very deſireable and of much concern to them, that thoſe belonging to their Domeſtick go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſhould be truly good and vertuous; for then they will have delight and contentment in the love and fidelity of their Wives, in the dutifulneſs and good carriage of their Children; and 'twill be for their ſatisfaction and advantage to have diligent and truſty Servants; likewiſe the Reputation and good Credit of a Family, is advanc'd and kept up by the ſober and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Lives of thoſe who are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

And when Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion prevails (beſide that it doth pull down the Curſes of God) it hath a natural cauſality for ruining the Family where it is; for it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually draws after it Idleneſs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and all the chargeable Vices; but the danger is greateſt and the Event moſt fatal, when through neglect of holy duties in any houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Children grow up in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and diſſoluteneſs, become a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to all buſineſs and induſtry for advancing their Fortunes in the World: and falling into extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Follies they often waſte the Patrimony left to them, and the Families which had long flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in riches and honour, are hereby reduced to meanneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; ſo that while Parents take no heed to have their Children train'd up in Piety, they run a very great hazard of loſing all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident care and labour in getting
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56907:46"/> or encreaſing their Eſtates; but if they would have them and the reſt of their Family to be ſuch as they ought to be, and thereby prevent all thoſe ill conſequences which they may otherwiſe expect, the moſt proper and effectual means will be, to keep up the practice of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their houſes, by reading the holy Scriptures and performing the great Duty of Prayer from day to day.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The publick Intereſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the good of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth very much depend on the pious Government of Families; for of theſe leſſer Societies, the greater one of the Common-wealth is made up, and the ſame perſons are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both; and therefore if Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Families would exerciſe a religious Diſcipline, and thereby promote holineſs and ſobriety in their reſpective houſes, it might then happily follow that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would be generally good, as when every one doth make clean before his own door the whole City is thereby cleans'd, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56907:46"/> it is that nothing can be ſo dangerous to any State, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to all the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the prevalence of Impiety and Vice, nor is there any thing that doth more contribute to the growth of theſe then a neglect of Religion in private Families; to this muſt be aſcribed in great meaſure, all the wicked diſorders of the preſent Age: for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that Prophaneneſs, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Whoredom, Thefts, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, and other enormities would ſo abound as they do, if perſons were religiouſly bred up and the people every where accuſtomed to pious performances in the houſes where they live; wherefore to the Laws of the Magiſtrate, and the Preaching of the Miniſter, the good care of the Houſholder muſt alſo be added, that Religion may thrive and the Kingdom become truly happy; as Chriſtianity had its Original in private houſes (for the Primitive Teachers did firſt propagate the Goſpel and adminiſter the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereof <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 42. 5. 42. 10. 48. 16. 15, 33. 20. 20.</note>) ſo on the Piety
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56907:47"/> of Families it doth ſtill depend for it's continuance and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. As private Families are ſo many little Societies in the whole Civil State, ſo in a Spiritual ſenſe they are ſuch with reſpect to the National Church, and we find in Scripture that each houſe the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers whereof did agree in the true Faith and Worſhip, was accounted for a Church and is often ſo call'd, as <hi>the houſe of</hi> Priſcilla <hi>and</hi> Aquila <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Philem.</hi> 2.</note>. Now as the Chriſtian Prince, becauſe he is Head of the Common-wealth hath alſo the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Charge over the whole Church included in it, ſo with ſome proportion the Domeſtick governour beſide the authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Houſhold in Secular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, hath alſo in ſome ſort a Spiritual rule as it is a kind of Church: and it therefore belongs to him to maintain the honour and worſhip of God within his leſſer Dominion. In the more ancient times of the Jewiſh Church, the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56907:47"/> Heads of Families had a ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal power to offer Sacrifice, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate in the Divine Worſhip for themſelves and thoſe belonging to them. We read how careful the holy Patriarchs were to provide themſelves Altars wherever they had their abode, by building con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places, as Chappels wherein together with their Families, they did offer both Sacrifices and Prayers unto God; thus <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 8. 29. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Gen. 12. 7, 8. <hi>and</hi> Chap. 13. 18. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 26. 25. and <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen 33. 20. <hi>and</hi> Chap. 25. 7. and that theſe Edifices were for Prayer as well as Sacrifice doth appear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 8. Where it is ſaid, <hi>And there he builded an Altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord;</hi> this right of dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Miniſtry from the Father of each Family, did after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe deſcend to his firſt born; which (ſay the Jews) made <hi>Jacob</hi> (being a pious good man) ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of the Birth-right <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 31.</note>: and becauſe <hi>Eſau</hi> did undervalue this ſacred priviledge by ſelling it at ſo
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56907:48"/> vile a rate, he is juſtly cenſur'd by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as a <hi>prophane perſon</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16.</note>.</p>
            <p>When by the modern Jews at this day the Paſſover is Celebrated in their houſes, the <hi>Pater-Familias</hi> or Maſter of the Family is inſtead of a Prieſt; for the Shoulder of Lamb or Kid, the unleavened Cakes, the Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being ready and ſet before them, he begins the Feaſt with a Prayer of Conſecration, and at ſeveral times afterward while that ſolemnity is a carrying on, he beſpeaketh God for himſelf and the reſt of his Family there preſent, in forms of thankſgiving; alſo at the end thereof he putteth up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prayer <note n="g" place="margin">

            <p>Of ſuch admirable uſe are the ſacred Books, for rectifying the minds and governing the Lives of men: and ſo well fitted are they for this excellent purpoſe; and we wonder that the good Father late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nam'd did eſteem them ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo much delight in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them; for after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>Cicero</hi> of whom he had been extremely fond before, became vile

            <p>Since therefore the goodneſs and condeſcention of Almighty God, have been ſo great in vouchſafing the holy Scripture, which is his kind Epiſtle from Heaven imparting his mind to us for our own good; what a rude and ungrateful indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will it be if we care not to read it?

            <p>It may further recommend to Chriſtian Families the conſtant uſe of Prayer and the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as very neceſſary to an holy Converſation, if we mention what St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath ſaid to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; to whom a great regard is due, not only for his Eminent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Divine things, but alſo for his own great experience in the Practice of Piety; by him it is

            <p>And at the entertainments of our times, how often is it, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56907:57"/> inſtead of calling upon the name of God, men prophane it by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oaths; inſtead of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read, the ears of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are taken up with looſe and filthy Communication; inſtead of holy Pſalms, they are made firſt merry and then mad with exceſs of liquors. Such impieties cannot be allow'd in Families, where the Governours of them are really good, nor will they conſiſt with that holy Diſcipline for which we are now pleading: they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ancient Practice of good Chriſtians, and much more to the Precepts of that holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which we all profeſs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the moſt preſſing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and that which all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Families ſhould lay to heart is ſtill behind, it is that in this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of domeſtick Devotion the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal welfare of Souls is greatly concern'd; for frequency in Prayer and reading of the Scriptures, being ſo requiſite as it is for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of holineſs, and a good life, where theſe are neglected, how
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56907:58"/> can it be expected, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will live as becometh the Goſpel, and as 'tis requir'd of all whom God will admit into that holy Place, which <hi>no unclean thing can enter</hi>

And what muſt become of ſuch in the other World, none can be ignorant that is acquainted with the Bible. Now it cannot be doubted, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Families are oblig'd in Conſcience to ſeek the Spiritual good and future happineſs of thoſe under their Government; if they provide not for them, as to the neceſſaries of this temporal Life, they have in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> account <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd the Faith, are worſe than Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi>

            <p>In the ancient times of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, Parents did eſteem it their greateſt charge and buſineſs to get their Children well inſtructed in Religion, and that the ſeeds of Vertue and Piety might be ſown in them betimes.

            <p>Some modern Examples might here be added; but I ſhall only mention one which may ſeem emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent enough to ſuffice inſtead of all: I mean, Sir <hi>Matthew Hale</hi> the late Lord Chief Juſtice; a man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be nam'd without a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his memory; he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the honour of his Country, and gave the greateſt credit to the time in which he liv'd.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56907:62"/> in his own profeſſion, and his admirable care and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Adminiſtration of his great Office, he was a moſt pious and devout Chriſtian; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly was eminently ſo in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick relation; he uſed conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to worſhip God in his Family, and the Duties of Religion there were always perform'd by himſelf if there were no Clergy-man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <note n="p" place="margin">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56907:62"/> in the publick Duties of the Church alſo he doth therein enjoin them, the Devotion of Prayer and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures in private; and we find him there putting them in mind, how <hi>It had been his practice to give them Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept, for enabling them to ſteer and order their courſe of life, through an evil and dangerous World:</hi> Now the example of this wiſe and good man, whoſe tranſcendent worth is yet freſh in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his reputation ſo great throughout the Nation, may, I hope, have ſome good influence to engage others in the ſame relation to a pious imitation of him; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really convinc'd, like as he was, of how great concern it is in reference to the future welfare of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their care and government.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56907:63"/> themſelves cannot ſuffer them to live in neglect of the important Duty we have been urging upon them; for they muſt alſo conſider that the ſtate and welfare of their own ſouls are herein moſt of all concern'd: Beſide, that the omiſſion of Prayer and Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, muſt needs be prejudicial and of ill conſequence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as to the reſt in their houſes; nor can they think well of their own condition to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, while they ſo much diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his Worſhip and Service: I ſay beſide all this, they cannot but think that the whole Sin and Guilt of this domeſtick Irreligion will be juſtly chargeable on them; and they muſt expect that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of thoſe who are of their Families will be laid to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as the Perſons who might and ought to have prevented the ſame; and if through want of pious Diſcipline, and the exerciſes of Devotion, their Children or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers belonging to their charge ſhall become profane and wicked,

O lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon us, which is much more deſireable than that of the Sun, and of greater value than all the Riches this World can afford: We confeſs, O Lord,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56907:68"/> that we are guilty Sinners, and ſo juſtly obnoxious to the frowns of thy diſpleaſure and the ſeverity of thy Juſtice. In Sin we were conceived, and brought forth in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; there are corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within us to Rebellion, and Diſobedience againſt thee and thy holy Commands, and theſe have very much prevailed in the whole courſe of our Lives; for from our Nativity to this preſent hour we have been ſtill offending the pure Eyes of thy holineſs, by evil thoughts and inordinate deſires, by vain Words and irregular Actions. We have neglected the Duties by thee enjoined, and committed the ſins which thou haſt ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p>But thou art a God gracious and merciful; who delighteth not in the death of a ſinner: and thy Son is a Mediatour of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reconciliation for all who come unto thee through him; we do beſeech thee therefore for his ſake in whom thou art well pleaſed, to pardon all our offences
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56907:69"/> and juſtifie our perſons, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us into thy love and favour as thine adopted Children.</p>
               <p>That we may be capable of theſe great benefits, be thou pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work in us an unfeigned repentance of all our ſins paſt, a lively Faith in the merits of thy Son, and ſerious reſolutions of leading a ſober, righteous, and godly life; let the power of thy Grace ſubdue and mortifie all corrupt luſts, and the Principles of ſin: and do thou endue us with all the Vertues of Chriſtian holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that being ſanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, all the Faculties of our Souls and Members of our Bodies may become inſtruments of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto holineſs, in thy Service and for thy Honour.</p>

But above all, we beg the preſence and aſſiſtance of thy ſpecial Grace, to preſerve us from ſin and all the temptations to it: that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inbred corruption nor the ſnares of the World, nor the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of Satan may draw us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from the way of righteouſneſs, but let a pious fear of thy great and holy name always poſſeſs our Souls. And that we may be the more careful and circumſpect in all our doings, help us to bear in mind that we are ſtill under thine all-ſeeing Eye to which all things are naked and open: and that we muſt one day appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy juſt Tribunal to receive according to the things done in the Body whether good or evil;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56907:70"/> let the conſideration of the future puniſhments which thou haſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deter us from ſin, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that glorious happineſs, which the Goſpel doth promiſe, encourage our obedience; that having a fixed eye on the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal recompence of reward, we may deſpiſe the pleaſures of ſin which are but for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>O Lord bleſs thy Church, purge it from all corruptions, and cauſe thy Goſple to be known and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by all the Nations of the Earth; more eſpecially, be favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thy Church and People of this Kingdome; pardon our many and great provocations; withold the Judgments we have deſerved; guide and protect our Soveraign Lord the King, and proſper his Government, that it may be happy both to himſelf and his Subjects.

               <p>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, with all that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Hoſt of Sun, Moon, and Stars, thou haſt founded the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath and given life and breath to all things living. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy ſignal kindneſs to our ſelves above the reſt of thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in that thou didſt Create man after thine own Image, making him little lower than the Angels; that thou haſt given him dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the works of thine hands, and made him capable of eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the ſervice and enjoyment of thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>O Lord, how manifold are thy works? in wiſdom haſt thou made them all, the earth is full of thy riches; and what is man that thou ſhouldeſt magnifie him? That thou ſhouldeſt ſet thine heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him?</p>
               <p>We do likewiſe extol thy love to mankind, which hath been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewn in the great work of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56907:76"/> our Redemption. That after we had broken the Laws of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſinning againſt thee, had faln ſhort of the glory of God, and were become liable to Death and Hell, thou wert pleas'd to ſend thine only begotten Son out of thine own boſom to ſave us from deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and reſtore us again to thy love and favour, who took on him the form of a Servant, liv'd a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted life, dy'd a painful and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death for us men and for our Salvation; he did alone thy juſtice by the Sacrifice of himſelf; overcame Death and the Grave, and finiſhed our Redemption by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to life the third day, when he was declar'd to be the Son of God with power by his wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, which we and all thy Church do this day commemorate.</p>
               <p>O God, thine acts of favour have been thus great and admirable to us-ward, we do therefore offer up our hearty praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for the diſcoveries of thy Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, in the Creation of us and the whole
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56907:77"/> World; for thy compaſſion and rich grace, in and through our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And we do here with deep Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance humble our ſelves, for that our lives have not better anſwered ſuch obligations of thine to duty and obedience; for we have ſinn'd againſt thee as thou art our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, by not loving and fearing thee as thou haſt deſerv'd, by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting thy ſervice, and employing our ſouls and bodies, which thou haſt made, in actions diſpleaſing to thee, and which thou haſt forbidden. We have offended thee as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Redemption, by not receiving the Goſpel with a due love and eſteem thereof, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our lives to its holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, nor walking ſuitably to that abundant grace, which hath therein appeared, teaching us to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts.</p>
               <p>But, O thou Father of Mercies, who delighteſt not in the death of ſinners, be thou pleas'd to pardon and juſtifie; to do away our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and receive us graciouſly;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56907:77"/> bleſs unto us all the means of grace, and the opportunities of receiving inſtruction from thine holy Word. When we appear before thee in the Congregation of thy people, help us to be ſerious and devout as in thy preſence, to join in Prayer with an intent and fervent mind, and to hear thy Word with reverence and ſubmiſſion; that by an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on thine holy Ordinances; we may encreaſe in Piety, and all the Graces of Chriſtian Holineſs; for the righteouſneſs and merits of that holy One, who died for our ſins and roſe again for our Juſtification.</p>
               <p>And we do alſo humbly beg for his ſake, that thou wouldeſt grant unto us thine holy Spirit and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Grace, whereby thine Image may be renewed in us, that we may from henceforth honour and ſerve thee from whom we have received our being, and help us more and more to conform our ſelves to the death of Chriſt by dying to ſin, and to his Reſurrection by riſing to holineſs and newneſs of life. To this good end we pray thee to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56907:78"/> grant that on this thine holy Day, we may ſanctifie thine holy Name, that our thoughts may be heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and our affections ſet on things above; that we may take delight in the exerciſes of religion and may be in thy fear all the day long.</p>
               <p>Bleſs thy Church and be thou graciouſly preſent in all Chriſtian Aſſemblies throughout the World, to hear the Prayers they ſhall this day put up, and to proſper thy Word which ſhall be Preached, that it may become effectual for pulling down the Kingdom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and for edifying the body of Chriſt in ſound Faith and real God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
               <p>Let the light of thy glorious Goſpel be ſpread abroad, and the borders of thy Sons kingdom daily enlarg'd. Call home thine ancient people the Jews, and bring in the fulneſs of the Gentiles, that all the Nations of the earth may be one ſheepfold under the one great ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of Souls.</p>
               <p>We implore thy particular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56907:78"/> for this Church and Kingdom; and more eſpecially for the Kings Majeſty, that he may have Wiſdom, Juſtice, Piety, and all princely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to govern according to thy Will for thy glory and the good of thy people. And let thy true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be continued to us for all generations.</p>
               <p>We preſent unto thee our hearty thanks for thy many and great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits vouchſafed to us; for our excellent being, our preſervation hitherto, and all temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for our birth and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a place where the truth and purity of thy Goſpel is profeſs'd and taught, where we have the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of worſhipping thee accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy Will, and do enjoy the precious means of Grace and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Good Lord help us to make a wiſe and Chriſtian uſe of all thy bleſſings, to improve all ſpiritual advantages for the good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our ſouls; that having well employed the Talents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, we may at length be

'Tis thy wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion that thou doeſt permit vile duſt and aſhes to have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of acceſs to thy Throne of grace; that thou art pleaſed to invite and command us to preſent our ſupplications.</p>
               <p>We are altogether unworthy to

               <p>But for as much as our ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is of thee, and of our ſelves alone we can do nothing that ſhall be good and acceptable in thy ſight, be thou pleas'd to ſupply our defects and ſtrengthen our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; let thine holy Spirit lead us into truth, and aſſiſt us in every good Duty.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56907:85"/> nature, we have more readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed than the righteous commands of thine excellent Laws; and our care hath been much greater about the things of this preſent life which are earthly and periſhing, then about things heavenly and ſpiritual, belonging to the life im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. We do therefore with ſhame and repentance humble our ſelves, beſeeching thee for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Mediation of thy bleſſed Son to pardon all our offences, and to receive us into thy love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as perfectly reconcil'd; let not our former unthankfulneſs or abuſe of mercies, withhold from us the gifts of thy bounty; but be thou pleas'd to beſtow and continue to us all the good things that may be requiſite and convenient for our comfortable ſubſiſtence in this World, and for our eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the life to come. O Lord, our Governour who ordereſt all things both in Heaven and earth, guide and diſpoſe all the affairs and occurrences of our preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as may be moſt for thy glory
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56907:86"/> and our real benefit; preſerve to us the health of our bodies, the uſe of our reaſon, of our ſenſes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary faculties; and let thy good providence ſtill watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us to defend us from evil and to do us good. More eſpecially, we beg the bleſſings of thy divine Grace for the ſanctification of our hearts and lives; enlighten our minds with the ſaving knowledg of thy ſelf and of Jeſus Chriſt, whom to know is life eternal; regulate our wills and affections, that we may chuſe what thou doeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and refuſe whatever thou haſt forbidden, that our love may be to thy Law and our chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in doing thy Commandements, and that we may hate every evil work. Enrich our ſouls with all Chriſtian Vertues, whereby we may be qualified to honour and ſerve thee, to lead a ſober, righteous, and godly life, with a Conſcience void of offence both towards thee, and towards all men. Amidſt all the dangers and temptations of this mortal ſtate, let thine Almighty
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56907:86"/> power be our ſhield and ſupport, give us minds ſuitable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for every diſpenſation of thy providence, that no events whether proſperous or afflicting may do us any harm; but that we may be conſtant and ſteddy in our Faith and Duty, and by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of well doing, may attain that life Eternal and Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which thou haſt promis'd.</p>
               <p>Bleſs thy Church throughout the World, that it may flouriſh in truth and holineſs, and remain ſafe from all perſecuting Powers. Be thou favourable to this Church and Kingdom to which we belong, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thy Goſpel to us, and grant that Piety, Juſtice, and whatever is is requiſite to make us a good and happy people may encreaſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>
               <p>We implore thy pity for all in any trouble or calamity, whether of Soul or Body, that thou wouldſt pleaſe to afford them thy comfort and ſeaſonable relief.</p>
               <p>And we likewiſe beg thy favour and ſpecial kindneſs, for all our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56907:87"/> friends, that thou wouldſt beſtow thy bleſſings upon them both for life and godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Accept, O Lord our return of thanks for thy goodneſs continued to us the day paſt, that thou doeſt ſtill ſupply us with accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the ſupport and comfort of our lives: that thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us from many evils, which if left to our ſelves we ſhould have fallen into: and that we are ſtill alive, whereas ſo many others have been this day cut off from the land of the living; we bleſs thee for ſparing us ſo long, and granting us ſo large a time for making our calling and election ſure; help us to improve thy long-ſuffering and the day of Grace, by working out our own ſalvation: That when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou ſhalt call us hence, we may be ready and prepar'd to enter into the joy of our Lord.</p>
               <p>We commend our perſons and all belonging to us, to thy care and protection, this night defend us from our ghoſtly enemies, and let no evil come nigh our dwelling;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56907:87"/> grant us a quiet and comfortable repoſe, and that we may awake in ſafety the next morning, diſpos'd both in body and mind for thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Hear us, O merciful Father, and fulfil our deſires for the ſake of our bleſſed Saviour who ſitteth at thy right hand, in whoſe words we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to pray unto thee.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56907:89"/> from time to time with our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſupplications: thou art moſt perfect and happy in thy ſelf, not needing any ſervice of ours, and yet thou art pleaſed to invite and command us to come unto thee: thou art the high and lofty one, the Maker and Governour of all the World, and yet doeſt condeſcend to receive the addreſſes of us thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are vile duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>We muſt confeſs, O Lord, that our righteouſneſs doth not extend to thee, nor can our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious performances deſerve thine acceptance, for there is iniquity in our moſt holy things; we do not attend upon thee, with that humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reverence, with that faith and ſervency, which thou mayeſt juſtly require. When we draw near unto thee with our lips, our hearts are often far from thee; we preſent our bodies before thee, when the thoughts and affections of our ſouls are running after vanity.</p>
               <p>And ſince our beſt Duties are ſo liable to thy diſpleaſure; how much more the ordinary and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56907:89"/> common actions of our life? and how can we ſtand before thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice if thou ſhouldſt call us to a ſtrict account for all our careleſs omiſſions of Duties by thee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and our many commiſſions of what thy Law hath expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden? If thou ſhouldſt be extreme to mark what is done amiſs, O Lord, who could abide it? but thou art a God full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and plenteous in mercy; and thou haſt given thine own Son to be our Mediator; though we have no righteouſneſs or oblation of our own that can procure thy favour, yet be thou gracious to us for the ſake of him who is the Lord our righteouſneſs, and for the merit of his moſt perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he made for us, when he offered up himſelf a Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh; let the blood of Chriſt cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs, and purge our conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God. And that we may from henceforth walk as the redeemed of the Lord unto all
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56907:90"/> well-pleaſing; give unto us thy grace and holy Spirit for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin, and the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us throughout in Soul, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in Body; grant that our hearts and lives may be conform'd to thy heavenly Will, and the Precepts of thine holy Goſpel; that we may fear thee at all times, and love thee above all things, and ſerve thee with our chiefeſt care and endeavour; let not the love of any worldly good, or the fear of any temporal evil cauſe us to turn aſide from thee into any ſinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: but grant that we may ſtill account it our higheſt intereſt to pleaſe thee and enjoy thy favour: and that we may be more careful and diligent in ſecuring our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs hereafter then for the momentary things of this preſent life; help us often to conſider the vanity of this World; the approach of death, and the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a future judgment; and to fix our thoughts on the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, that ſo we may be ſtedfaſt and immoveable, in the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56907:90"/> Duties of our Chriſtian profeſſion, as well knowing that our labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</p>
               <p>And becauſe our life is but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour which doth quickly vaniſh, and we know not how ſoon thou wilt bring us to the duſt of death, give us daily to prepare for our great change, and to be doing good while we have time and opportunity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no work nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Grave whither we are going.</p>
               <p>We render our due thanks for thy great mercy and long ſuffering in the continuance of our life hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and lengthening out unto us the day of Grace and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereas ſo many others who might have lived to this time as well as we, have been removed from the land of the living.

               <p>Let thy word abide in us, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king root in our hearts, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth good fruit in our life and actions; and grant that all the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtructions we at any time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, may prove effectual for buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us up in our holy Faith, and helping us forward in the way of holineſs, which leadeth to eternal life.</p>
               <p>We beg thy mercy for all thoſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56907:91"/> Nations, which yet ſit in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death, that the Sun of Righteouſneſs may ariſe upon them to guide their feet into the way of peace. And be thou pleas'd to extend thy fatherly pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all the diſtreſſed Members of thy Church, giving them ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable relief in all their afflictions and neceſſities; more eſpecially be thou near at hand to the comfort and deliverance of all thoſe who are any where oppreſſed or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for the ſake of thy Truth and Goſpel, and grant that the rage of thine and thy peoples ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may be at length reſtrained; cauſe the wickedneſs of the wicked to come to a perpetual end, but let the juſt be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>We recommend to thy ſpecial care our own particular friends, and all more nearly related to us, that thou wouldeſt bleſs them in their ſouls and bodies, and give them all the good things, that may be for their proſperity here, and their eternal happineſs hereafter.</p>
               <p>Finally, we deſire for our ſelves

               <p>O Lord our heavenly Father, who art a God full of compaſſion, and haſt promiſed that if we call upon thee in trouble thou wilt deliver us, bow down thine ear to our ſupplications, and let us find mercy to help in this time of need.</p>
               <p>Our life is in thine hand, for in thee we live, and move, and have our being from day to day: and when thou hideſt thy face we are troubled: at the breath of thy diſpleaſure, we wither as Graſs, and fade away as the flower of the Field; but thy Mercy is over all thy Works; thou doeſt not willingly afflict nor grieve the Children of men; thine anger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth but for a moment; but in thy favour is life. O Lord, be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable at this time and extend thy
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56907:95"/> wonted pity to thy Servant now labouring under thy viſitation; who is there in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth on whom we can relie for ſuccour but thy ſelf alone. Thou canſt ſend eaſe and recovery, when humane skill and natural means do quite fail: and thou haſt declared in thy Word that the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the ſick. O Lord, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith and fulfil thy gracious promiſe; our truſt is only in thee, for on thee do we depend for life and health and all things. 'Tis thy property that thou doeſt kill and make alive, thou doeſt wound and alſo heal, that thou turneſt man to deſtruction and ſayeſt return ye Children of men.</p>
               <p>We do therefore moſt heartily beſeech thee, O merciful Father, that as thou haſt laid thine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the perſon of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſo thou wouldeſt of thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſion remove it from him (her); bleſs the means that may be uſed for his (her) recovery: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the diſtemper, and if it be thy

               <p>O bleſſed Jeſus, who when thou waſt on earth hadſt compaſſion on the ſick, and didſt go about heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of diſeaſes, ſhew now thy pity, ſpeak but the word and thy Servant ſhall be whole. Thou Lord our Redeemer, who haſt taken our frail nature, and didſt become like unto us in all things, Sin only excepted, have a fellow feeling, we pray thee, of our infirmities. Thou who art the myſtical head of all the Faithful afford thy preſent kindneſs to this afflicted member of thine own body, which is the Church.</p>
               <p>Grant, O merciful Father, that while his (her) bodily weakneſs or pain ſhall continue, he (ſhe) may have inward ſtrength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the ſoul. Vouchſafe unto him (her) the conſtant uſe of his (her) reaſon and underſtanding, and a pious exerciſe of all Chriſtian graces. Enable him (her) with unfeigned repentance to lament the errours of his (her) whole
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56907:96"/> life, and by a lively Faith to lay hold on the Merits of Chriſt for Pardon and Salvation; help him (her) with ſubmiſſion and godly patience to bear thy chaſtiſement, reſigning himſelf (herſelf) to thy good pleaſure; and let his (her) whole truſt and conſidence be in thee and thy gracious promiſes. Grant him (her) a full remiſſion of all his (her) ſins, and a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſſurance of thy love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which is more deſireable than life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>O moſt wiſe and powerful God, who canſt make all things work together for good, ſanctifie this thy fatherly correction, that it may turn to his (her) ſpiritual benefit, and let the iſſue thereof be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and happy; grant that the affliction, which at preſent doth ſeem grievous, may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward yield the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs, and that it may make him (her) more fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for that happy ſtate in which there ſhall be no more ſickneſs nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ALTHOUGH it be the more eminent part of our Chriſtian Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we join with others in the Service of God (who is thereby openly own'd and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by us, and we do by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, both encourage and aſſiſt the Piety of others) whether it be

            <p>Under this private Devotion in its full notion are comprized Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Meditation, reading of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and other pious Books; and though we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with reſpect to the firſt of theſe eſpecially, yet we would not be thought to divide ſuch good company, but while recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing private Prayer to intend Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Reading too; they do indeed mutually aſſiſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we cannot be without either of them. Now to enforce this excellent Duty in which both the reality and comfort of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian do ſo very much conſiſt, we ſhall briefly propoſe ſome perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive conſiderations, which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prevail on all who are truly diſpos'd to the Practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the proſecution of their own intereſt.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It doth appear out of holy Scripture, that we are not only to worſhip God and call upon him in company with others, but that he
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56907:101"/> expects moreover, to be honour'd by the devout ſervice of every man ſingly and apart, and that each perſon in his own behalf, ſhould ſeek unto him for his benefits: this is manifeſtly contain'd in thoſe Texts, where it is given in charge that every one addreſs himſelf to God on his own particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>as to call upon him in the day of trouble</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15.</note>, and <hi>if any man be afflicted let him pray</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 13.</note>; In which places it cannot only be meant that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty afflicted is to crave the Prayers of the Congregation, or of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter where he lives; but chiefly at leaſt, that he is himſelf alone to call upon God and ſupplicate for his help and deliverance; and this muſt be done in many ſad caſes which afford no opportunity of having the Prayers of others; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when we are bid <hi>in every thing to make known our requeſts</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6.</note>, it muſt needs intend that we are to do it in particular caſes and matters of private concern; though they fall not under the publick or ordinary Prayers.</p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:56907:101"/>
            <p>And when 'tis commanded that <hi>in all places we lift up holy hands</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8.</note>, it doth certainly include the places of our privacy and retirement; and this Text, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> will have peculiarly underſtood of private Prayer <note n="g" place="margin">Conc. Lat. De Vener. Sac.</note>. But the precept of our Saviour is very expreſs, <hi>Enter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut the door pray to thy Father which is in ſecret</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6.</note>; the words are plain, and to neglect the duty enjoin'd in them is to live in a known ſin, which we are highly concern'd to beware of as we tender the ſafety of our ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us ſet before us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of eminent and renowned perſons by whoſe practice this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of private Devotion is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us.

               <hi>to meditate in the Eventide;</hi> but the original word doth ſignifie <hi>ſubmiſſa voce loqui labio tenùs murmurare, to ſpeak juſt moving the lips,</hi> without any audible ſound, as is wont to be in private prayer more than in meditation, and thus it was in the ſupplication of <hi>Hannah</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13.</note>; but that the Verb in that place may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>to pray</hi> doth appear from hence, that the Subſtantive coming from it is uſed for Prayer, in other Texts of Scripture; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 1. and 19. 14. and therefore both in the <hi>Caldee</hi> Paraphraſe and the <hi>Arabick</hi> verſion, it is: <hi>And</hi> Iſaac <hi>went out to pray;</hi> likewiſe it is thus underſtood by <hi>Munſter, Vatablus,</hi> and the ſame is approv'd by <hi>Grotius;</hi> we are alſo told by the firſt of theſe, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves have generally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Text in this ſenſe; but whether it be meant of Prayer or Meditation, 'tis much indifferent to the preſent purpoſe, ſince the latter as well as the former is an act of Devotion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56907:108"/> out of their neglect herein; who profeſs a Religion that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the ſtricteſt rules of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who are alſo clearly inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the holy Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Duty to God, and have ſingular inducements to the performance of it. And ſince they who wanted all theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages could yet eſteem it their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty, to be ſingly devout as well as in company with others, it muſt be a ſtrange piece of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in us, if we think it too great trouble to wait on the living and true God with our private ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: and it will be altogether inexcuſable, ſhould we confine our Worſhip of him to the Chriſtian Aſſemblies: as if it were not worth while to ſerve God, but where we may be ſeen by men.</p>
            <p n="3">III. There are ſo many private concerns and accidental occurrences to each Chriſtian, as make it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary that he apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God in ſecret prayer; as when he is to confeſs or beg the pardon of any particular ſin he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56907:109"/> hath unhappily fall'n into; or to deſire the removal of ſome preſent affliction on himſelf or belonging to him; when he is to implore the aſſiſtance of divine Grace againſt ſome Temptation with which he is beſet, or the protection of divine Providence from an imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whereof he is afraid: when concern'd to crave the preſence and bleſſing of God in any buſineſs or undertaking, wherein he may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, or to return him due thanks for ſome ſpecial mercy he hath lately receiv'd. Now if the caſe be thus private and particular, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite our Prayers ſhould be ſo too: which cannot be as it ought, either with reſpect to God or our ſelves, unleſs ſuitable to ſuch like occaſions whenever they ſhall happen. And we find in Scripture, how the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have us'd to adopt their devotion to their preſent exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the various circumſtances of their condition; as <hi>Jacob</hi> in that Prayer of his, when under appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of violence from <hi>Eſau</hi> his Brother <note n="l" place="margin">

That privacy is in a ſpecial manner advantageous to devotion, and the better exerciſe thereof; it hath indeed been ever thought of greateſt convenience to all thoſe acts and employments that belong to the rational part and require the intentions of the mind; whence many of the Philoſophers of old choſe to withdraw from places of concourſe, that they might more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually give themſelves up to

            <p>It muſt be granted that this at length corrupted into Superſtition, Idleneſs, and an empty name; and we cannot think it any real ſervice to religion to perſuade men (as ſome have done) wholly to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don humane Society; ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it without laying aſide many important duties, both for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God and the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; yet for ſome time and on ſome ſpecial occaſion of a mans life it may be of neceſſary uſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from the World and the affairs of it; it was ſo thought by a great and wiſe Prince in the laſt Age.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56907:112"/> fell into a good liking of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and dy'd a real Convert to it.</p>
            <p>Now whatever there is in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy by which it doth contribute to Piety, and our better ſervice of God, may alwaies be found in the cloſe retirement of ſecret devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a man is then ſeparate from the World, from all company, and buſineſs; may freely converſe with God, and his own Soul; may for his ſpiritual benefit contemplate the Word of God, and all his wondrous Works, the things that have been, that are, and which ſhall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and while thus taken up, it may be truly ſaid of him, <hi>That he is never leſs alone then when alone.</hi> 'Tis almoſt peculiar to ſingle devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it doth admit the uſeful Duty of holy Meditation; which cannot ſo well be exercis'd, when we join in publick: and whatever the Duty be wherein we are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately engag'd, we can more eaſily be ſerious and intent in it then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the uſual occaſions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the mind, which are in

            <p>And as privacy is thus helpful to our being more heavenly and devout, ſo in the ſingle exerciſe of Piety there is this other advantage, that whereas in publick devotion we are confin'd to ſuch Prayers as are intended for general uſe, and therefore cannot reach every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe: the Chriſtian when praying alone can with freedom lay open his wants and deſires; he is not then bound up to words nor things, but may chuſe the matter of Prayer, and ſpeak for himſelf as his own heart ſhall ſuggeſt and his preſent condition require; for though Forms of private devotion, are very expedient and indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the greateſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet (as a late reverend Divine of our Church hath ſaid <note n="u" place="margin">

And it muſt needs have the like effect as including holy Meditation, of God as Creatour, Lord, and Judge of Mankind, as infinite in Holineſs, Knowledg, Juſtice, Power, and the Author of all the good we have, or do hope to enjoy: of our ſelves as Beings dependent, ſinful, frail, and as having immortal Souls, which

To this end bleſs unto me thine holy Ordinances; make them effectual for my ſpiritual benefit; and grant that in the religious Duties of this holy day, I may ſanctifie thee in my heart, and make thee my fear and dread.</p>
               <p>O Lord this is a day ſet apart for thine honour in remembrance of the Worlds Creation; which thou didſt complete in ſix days: and of our redemption by Chriſt, which was finiſhed by his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I do therefore aſcribe unto thee Praiſe, Thankſgiving, and Worſhip, for this glorious Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, and the whole variety of Creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in them; more eſpecially, for that excellent being thou haſt given to man; whom thou didſt make after thine own likeneſs, and advance to an eminence and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56907:130"/> over the Works of thine hands.

               <p>And prais'd be thy Name for thy great Mercy and rich Grace in ſending thine only begotten Son, from thine own boſom, to redeem Mankind from Sin and Miſery; and to direct the World in the right way of Life and Salvation. I bleſs thee for the manifeſtation of the Goſpel by him Preached, and for the great confirmation of it by his Reſurrection from the dead; let the light of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctrine ſhine over all the Earth, that ſo all the Kingdoms thereof may become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Be propitious to that part of the

               <p>More eſpecially be thou graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to this Church and Kingdom whereof I am a Member; pardon our abuſe of thy great Mercies, and all other our provocations; grant that the Inhabitants of the Land may turn from the evil of their ways unto the Lord their God: that thou mayeſt rejoice over us to do us good; give us outward peace, and proſperity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thy Goſpel and true Religion to us, and the Poſterities that ſhall come after us: I beg thy kindneſs for all who are my particular friends, or more nearly related to me, that thou wouldeſt bleſs them in their perſons and in all their concernments both of this life and of that which is to come. And, ô
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56907:131"/> thou who art the Father of Mercy and God of all conſolation, ſhew thy tender pity to all who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain, ſickneſs, want, ſorrow, or any other calamity; and wherever there be any that ſuffer perſecution for the ſake of righteouſneſs or in defence of thy Truth and Goſpel, be thou near to them for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and happy deliverance.</p>
               <p>Have reſpect, O God, to the Prayers and Supplications of thy people, which ſhall this day be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies throughout the World; aſſiſt and bleſs thy holy Word which ſhall be preached, that men may be edified by it in ſound Faith and real God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>

               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:56907:140"/>
               <p>Enable me to walk as becomes the Goſpel, having a Conſcience void of offence both towards God and towards Men: that as he who hath called me is holy, ſo I may be holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>Take off my affections from earthly things which are vain and periſhing, and ſet them on the things above in which alone my true happineſs doth conſiſt; fit me by ſuitable grace for every diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of thy Providence: that I may know how to want and how to abound, how to mourn or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, how to be in ſickneſs or in health, and in every condition to be therewith content; let thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly wiſdom cauſe all things to work together for good unto me; and that the ſeveral occurrences of the preſent life may help me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in my Chriſtian courſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the attainment of eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>And becauſe my nature is frail, my life uncertain, and I know not how ſoon I ſhall be taken from the

               <p>O God, who art the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of mankind, and didſt ſend thine own Son that the World through him might be ſaved, extend thy goodneſs to all the kindreds of the earth, cauſing the light of thy glorious Goſpel to ſhine upon them, that their feet may be guided into the way of peace and everlaſting happineſs; let all Nations become ſubject to the Kingdom of thy Chriſt, and the number of thine Elect be filled up, that the glory of thy Salvation may be revealed.</p>
               <p>Accept, O Lord, my evening ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, for all thy rich Mercies vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me. I bleſs thee for my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſince by thee I have been fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

               <p>But above all I magnifie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore thine ineſtimable goodneſs, in making known unto me the way of ſalvation and happineſs by Jeſus Chriſt, in continuing to me the ſeaſons of Grace, and of waiting upon thee in thine holy Ordinances; help me to make ſuch a good and pious uſe of all thy benefits, as may be for thy glory and for mine own eternal welfare.</p>
               <p>And ſince thy wiſe Providence hath ordain'd that the Night ſhould ſucceed the Day as a time of reſt and refreſhment, I pray thee that this Night may be ſo to me thy Servant: grant me to be ſafe and ſecure under thy protection from all the terrours and perils of darkneſs, and to awake the next morning in health and ſafety: O Lord, hear my Prayer, and let thy preſence and loving-kindneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be with me to the end of my

               <p>ALmighty God and moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father; thou art the Author of my being; and as my life, my health, and ſtrength are from thee, ſo they are and ought

O Lord, I bear about me a body of Sin and Death, and am liable to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of that firſt tranſgreſſion; for by one man Sin entered into the World and Death by Sin. Likewiſe the practice of my life hath been very evil, and my ſins ſtill repeated from day to day. I have not made it my chief buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſerve and glorifie thee which is the end of my Creation: nor hath the time of my life and health been employ'd as it ought in doing and receiving good. The faculties of my Soul and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of my Body have been made the inſtruments of Sin. I have not been duly thankful for thy manifold Mercies, nor made a right uſe of them; and I have too much deſpis'd thy goodneſs and forbearance which ſhould have lead me to repentance.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:56907:143"/>
               <p>I do therefore acknowledg the juſtice of thy dealings; for why ſhould a man complain of the puniſhment of his ſins.</p>
               <p>But, O thou Father of Mercies, who delighteſt not in the death of a ſinner; be favourable unto me. Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, neither let thine anger wax hot againſt me, but forgive my Sin and deliver me, for in thee do I truſt.</p>
               <p>I know, O Lord, that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons riſe not from the Duſt, but are of thy ſending; and I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to hear the voice of thy Rod, and to turn to him that ſmiteth. I do with hearty repentance hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf at thy footſtool, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting all the errours of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life: and I do give up my Soul and Body to thy Will and Governance; reſolving and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing by thy Grace to live and act hereafter in all holy obedience to thee and thy righteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. O deal not with me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mine iniquities, nor puniſh me
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56907:144"/> as I have deſerved; but remember the ſufferings of thy Son, who himſelf bore our ſickneſſes, and the puniſhment due to us in his own death. I believe in him as my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone Saviour; my truſt is in his Merits; and I do humbly beg for his ſake that thou wouldſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd unto me: that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heal my Body and comfort my Soul.</p>
               <p>O God, who art the preſerver, of men, who haſt declared in thy word that thou art nigh unto ſuch as pray unto thee, and haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to deliver when call'd upon in the day of trouble, be thou pleas'd to bow down thine ear, and extend thy compaſſion, in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtemper under which I now labour; do thou who art the great Phyſitian preſcribe and bleſs the means that may be for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: and reſtore me again if it be thy bleſſed Will to a ſtate of health and ſtrength, then will I praiſe thee with a thankful heart and will ſerve thee faithfully all my daies. But I do humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56907:144"/> my ſelf to thy good pleaſure, and not my will but thine be done. Though thou viſit with thy Rod yet take not thy loving kindneſs from me; and while my body ſhall be afflicted, be thou pleas'd to ſtrengthen and ſupport my Soul with thy Grace and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; help me with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Chriſtian patience to bear thy chaſtiſement; with a firm and conſtant faith to truſt in thee and thy pretious promiſes. Grant that this preſent viſitation may be ſanctifi'd to my ſpiritual benefit, and through thy wiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the iſſue turn to my real advantage, and that I may by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience know that in very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs thou haſt afflicted me. Let this thy fatherly correction teach me to be more dutiful and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: and grant that by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vanity and uncertainty of health of life and worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I may be the more careful to ſet my affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and to breath after that immortal life of perfect bliſs
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56907:145"/> which thy Goſpel hath promis'd. And grant, O Lord, that whether in health or ſickneſs, in proſperity or affliction, I may ſtill honour and ſerve thee: that whether I live I may live unto thee, and whether I die I may die unto thee, that whether I live or die I may be thine; And ſo an entrance may be miniſtred to me into the everlaſting Kingdom of my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: In whoſe Name and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, I do earneſtly recommend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee my preſent condition, and all my Concern; both of Soul and Body; praying further in his Words, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thy Grace, O Lord Jeſus Chriſt, my Redeemer, thy Love, O Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, thy Conſolation, O bleſſed Spirit of Grace, be with me and all thy People henceforth and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
